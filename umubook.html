                        During the course Databases and Web Based Systems we were tasked with building an application and data access layer on top of a relational database using SQL. 
                        Me and some class mates decided to try building a social network/online forum.

                    <p>
                        Conventionally a graph based database might be prefered for a system such as a social network. However as this course required the use of SQL and relational databases we decided to try building a social networking service in this rather unconventional way.
                        The structure of the social network was inspired by Twitter (X) and simple online forums, consisting of a dynamic between users and posts, and how they interact with eachother.
                        The project gave me a lot of experience crafting SQL queries and taught me some valuable lessons in how to (and probably more how not to) construct efficient relational databases.
                        Different ways to encrypt and store users passwords also had to be explored.

                    <h1>The Result</h1>
                    <p>
                        Although not very highly efficient from a performance standpoint the resulting product is a working social netowrk service, allowing users to sign up and create a profile.
                        They can then post content in the form of text and/or images. Signed in users can search for and follow other accounts, posts from these accounts will then show up in their feed.
                        Users can like, share and reply to on other users posts. All replies to a post will be shown in a sub-feed under the original post. 
                        A shared post will also show up in the feed of all users following the sharer with a notice that it is being shared by them.
