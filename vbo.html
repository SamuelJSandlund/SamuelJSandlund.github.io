        <p>The cheesemakers behind famous Swedish cheese Västerbottensost ® wanted to let young adults learn about their history and the story behind how the best cheese in Sweden was invented. We found a way to attract more young adults to their website, as well as incorporate more elements of storytelling into it.</p>

    <section class="gallery">
        <div class="row">
            <img src="media/vbo/wireframe.png" alt="">
            <p>Multiple approaches to increase the interest in the story were tested, including gamification and the option to have the story read to you like a podcast. User tests however showed that this alone would be enough for them to go out of their way to visit the website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <img src="media/vbo/hifi.png" alt="">
            <p>We now knew that part of the problem was not a lack of interest in learning about the history, rather that the audience didn’t find a reason to go out of their way to visit the cheese’s website. We had to give them a reason. Our solution to this was a community feature where users could share their favourite recipes with Västerbottensost® from around the world. They could then be given the option to listen to the story while doing something else, for example cooking.</p>
