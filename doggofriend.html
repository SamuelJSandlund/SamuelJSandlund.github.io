                    <p>
                        This project was started as a part of a course in Business Development during the first half of my fourth year in the Interaction Technology and Design program at Umeå University. 
                        DoggoFriend is an Internet of Things (IoT) system that brings dog owners closer to their pets while at work or school through a set of interactive devices connected to an app on their phone.
                        The project was awarded the price of best business idea in the course for that year, due to its potential to disrupt traditional retail of pet products through the applications built in store.

                        DoggoFriend is the resulting project from the course Business Service Design and Technology Development at Umeå University. 
                        During the course we were tasked with creating a business idea and develop it through the principles of the Business Model Canvas and create a prototype.
                        The project was then pitched in a "Dragons' Den / Shark Tank-style" to a board consisting of univeristy and business world representatives, focusing on value creation, profitability and sustainability of the proposed business model.

                    <h1>The Solution</h1>
                    <p>
                        The DoggoFriend-system consists of a set of connected devices and home appliances catered towards dogs and other pets.
                        The core value proposition of the system is its way of entertaining pets that have to stay alone at home for parts of the day, as well as a way for pet owners to check in with, feed, and play with their pets remotely through their smartphones. 
                        Through this DoggoFrined provides peace of mind to pet owners during the hours they have to leave their beloved pets alone, a situation that can often feel very stressful.
                        The DoggoFriend application also comes with a built in shop from which additional DoggoFriend products can be purchased along with food and treats for the users pets, as well as pet-related products from partnered brands.
                        At the end of the course DoggoFriend was awarded a price for best business idea.
