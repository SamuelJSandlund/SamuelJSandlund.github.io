                    <h1>Världens Västerbottensost</h1>
                    <p>
                        This project was in colaboration with the dairy company Norrmejerier and renowned Swedish cheese Västerbottensost, during the course Design for User Experience at Umeå Institute of Design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Västerbottensost were looking for a new webpage to use as a product and brand home, and wanted an innovative solution that would help them attract younger people (people between 18 and 40) to the site.
                        As a product home page the rich history, culture and assured quality of the brand should also be conveyed. 
                        The end goal was to further the image of Västerbottensost as "THE Swedish cheese" (similarly to how Parmigiano-Reggiano is to Italy or Manchego is to Spain).

                    <h1>The Process</h1>
                    <p>
                        The design process is rarely straight forward. The original idea was to make a semi-interactive story application where the users get to explore the history of how the popular cheese was first created and how it rose to prominence in Sweden.
                        However, user testing showed that, while the approach was good at showcasing the history of the brand, it was unlikely to make the target audience use the application on their own volition. Thus the solution had feature something that felt useful to younger people, who may be too busy in their daily lives to do actively research the history of their favourite cheese.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the new ideas was to combine two types of services that are popular with the target audience, that being online recipe books and social media.

                    <h1>The Result</h1>
                    <p>
                        The final result is a hi-fi prototype of what we chose to call "Världens Västerbottensost" (Västerbottensost of the World). Världens Västerbottensost is a community driven website where users can upload their own recipes that include Västerbottensost in any shape or form.
                        The recipes are sorted by country of origin and are displayed on a world map. While following a recipe (or waiting for their food to cook) the user is encouraged to listen to (or read) the story of Västerbottensost, separated into bite sized episodes. 
                        The episodes of the story are displayed similarly to how episodes of a tv-show are on a streaming service.
