                        A mashup (read: "frankensteins monster of multiple Web APIs combined to create a new service") that makes exploring the most trending songs around the world easier and more exciting.
                        This web-application was developed as the final project in the course Applications Development for Internet.

                    <p>
                        During a course focused on the development of web-applications the final project was to create a mashup by combining two or more APIs. One very extensive Web API is provided by Spotify, containing information about all the songs, artists and playlists in their database.
                        This API was used as backbone for the project and a foundation to create something new. The idea for the project was to design a different way of interacting with the database, allowing users to discover music an a way that does not include search bars and scrolling through menus.
                        By combining the Spotify API with a world map from the Mapbox API the idea to make an interactive world map became the focus of the project.

                    <h1>The Result</h1>
                    <p>
                        Spotify Map displays a map of the entire world through which a user can click on any country or region to view the most played songs there. 
                        However if Spotify is not available in the country songs can not be displayed. 
                        If Spotify is available in the country but does not keep statistics of the most played songs the top songs are gathered from other available APIs and put into a new playlist, provided that the song is available on Spotify.
                        The use of the application requires a Spotify account and is currently invite only, but there are plans to update the project to meet Spotify's design standards and publicly release it as a plugin. If you want to try out the application for yourself let me know and we can figure something out.
